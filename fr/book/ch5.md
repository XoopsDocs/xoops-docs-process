# XOOPS Docs Starter-Kit

In order to simplify the process of creating XOOPS Documentation, we have provided a Starter-Kit, containing at this moment:

* Starter-kit for a XOOPS Module Tutorial
* Starter-kit for a generic book \(based on work of  [MrMaximize](https://github.com/MrMaksimize/gitbook-starter-kit)\)

You can download the **XOOPS Docs Starter-Kit** from [**GitHub XOOPS Docs**](https://github.com/XoopsDocs/gitbook-starterkit)

To use the XOOPS Docs Starter-Kit, copy the content of the selected Starter-Kit over your newly created repository, adjust it as needed, and then follow the standard Process Workflow described earlier.
