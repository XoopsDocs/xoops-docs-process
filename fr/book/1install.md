# 1.0 Process Requierements


1.Access to GitHub and an account account there

2) Access to GitBook and an account there.

And of coures, you should know how to use GitHub.

But the main tool for us will be GitBook. GitBook is a tool for building beautiful books with markdown. It can generate your book in multiple formats: PDF, ePub, mobi or as a wesbite.

There are two ways of approaching writing a book using GitBook:

1) Open an account on GitBook and place all your files there.

2) Open an account on GitHub as well as on GitBook, and use GitHub as the repositor for the content, and GitBook as the Editor, and later as the Publisher of your books.

The advantage of using GitHub is because we can have all the books and documents being created in one location, the XOOPS Docs area (https://github.com/XoopsDocs, and that i will be visible to all our vistiors and friends.  We have our development for the next generation of XOOPS already on GitHub, so we can us our existing tools and approaches to very easily fork a particular documumnt, make changes, and then create a Pull Request.

Another iteresting aspect is that GitBook enables us to create multi-lingual documentation, and all of this from one and the same repository:

Multi-Languages

GitBook supports building books written in multiple languages. Each language should be a sub-directory following the normal GitBook format, and a file named LANGS.md should be present at the root of the repository with the following format:

* [English](en/)
* [French](fr/)
* [Espa√±ol](es/)
You can see a complete example with the Learn Git book.
