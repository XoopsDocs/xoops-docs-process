[**XOOPS**](http://xoops.org) was always known for a very good code, good architecture, and its modular approach, but we were never able to create good documentation.

With the recent technological advances, especially around GitHub, we believe we have now found tools that will help us to:

a) streamline the process and make it more efficient
b) engage the community by leveraging the same "forking and submitting pull requests" process as they they user at the normal coding activities.
