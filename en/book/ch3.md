1) We edit our book using the GitBook Editor 

2) Every time we save our work in the Editor, it will be saved on GitHub

3) If we have set a GitBook webhook to the repository, every time we commit our work to GitHub repository, it triggers GitBook to re-publish the book

4) The user will have automatically access to the latest and greatest version
