# XOOPS Docs Starter-Kit

In order to simplify the process of creating XOOPS Documentation, we have provided a Starter-Kit, containing at this moment:
- starter-kit for a XOOPS Module Tutorial
- starter-kit for a generic book (based on work of  [MrMaximize](https://github.com/MrMaksimize/gitbook-starter-kit))
 
You can download or fork the XOOPS Docs Starting-Kit from [GitHub XOOPS Docs](https://github.com/XoopsDocs/gitbook-starterkit)


1) if you have forked the XOOPS Docs Starter Kit, please:

* Rename the repo to what you want your book to be called:
  * Click settings from the home screen of the forked repo (forking creates a copy of the repository under your username). ([screenshot](http://mrm-screen.s3.amazonaws.com/MrMaksimizegitbookstarterkit_20140707_100321_20140707_100325.png))
  * Rename the repo ([screenshot](http://mrm-screen.s3.amazonaws.com/Options_20140707_100417_20140707_100421.png))
* Clone the repo to your local machine (manually, or using the [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com/) if you're using Windows, and plan to do some work locally
 

2) if you have downloaded XOOPS Docs Starter-Kit and want to use it on a brand new book, then just copy the content of the XOOPS Docs Starter-Kit over your new repository, adjust it as needed, and then follow the standard Process Workflow described earlier.
